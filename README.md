weather2music is A responsive web app that displays song recommendations based on the weather. Built in modern React.js using API connections to Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap and Youtube Data API.

I started by designing the concept and UI in Figma,
then I used plain HTML and CSS to build the components,
and finally I created a react app using create-react-app npm.

In this project I use these hooks:
- useState
- useEffect
- useLayoutEffect
- useRef
- useContext

Along with custom hooks I've built, reactive UI, weather analyzing and song recommendation logic.
